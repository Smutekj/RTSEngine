# RTSEngine
Simple real-time-strategy game engine. Does Path-finding of groups of agents on a dynamic constrained Delaunay triangulation. Agents can have various sizes but the forces for bigger agents are not very "good-looking" yet. Can build buildings and walls with edges poinitng in one of 8 general directions (N,S,W,E,NE,NW,SE,SW).
